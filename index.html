            <p>
                In this era of the digital age, information has become more accessible to us than ever before. We live in a world where there is an endless supply of content, generated to meet the<br> ever growing need for it. <br><br> However, the longer we spend on our screen the more we blur the boundaries between what is excessive and what is common place. We are growing accustomed to information <br>overloads; that inevitably take a toll on our mental health. This is especially prevalent in the case of information that could trigger a user, such as world news, fringe content, etc.<br><br>Therefore, a pressing need of the hour is to provide users with a means of consuming their information in a regulated and mindful manner.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>MoodEye:Your Digital Guardian</h3>
            <p>
                Our application MoodEye is built with the sole purpose of regulating the digital consumption of users, by keeping them mindful of their emotional state while browsing on the Internet.<br>
<br>
Once activated, it will keep track of a user's facial expressions for the duration of their browsing session. A predefined threshold has been set for each emotion. Once that threshold has been crossed, an overlay window will cover the screen for a period of 10 minutes. This serves as a digital time-out for the user.<br>
<br>
This forces the user to temporarily disconnect and separate themselves from the content they were consuming at the time, thereby reducing the likelihood of them falling into an information "rabbit-hole".<br><br>
